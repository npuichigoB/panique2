refactoring !
change username/email for facebook-people

lastInsertId() might be a not-optimal choice for multicore-high-traffic-environments,
maybe the last ID should be fetched in a cleaner way (asking for username)

TODO: refactoring the quite deep if/else structures
TODO: split positive and negative feedback (this->errors)

TODO: deactivate username-changing / email-changing for facebook-users
TODO: avatars for facebook-users
TODO: logout for facebook-users
TODO: remove forgot-password for facebook-users

WEIRD: When tab is pinned in Firefox, the Facebook-Login will open another tab
