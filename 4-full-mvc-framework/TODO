REFACTORING / IMPROVEMENTS

TODO: Make it impossible to see the login form when logged in (even when directly url-typed)
TODO: refactoring the quite deep if/else structures
TODO: split positive and negative feedback (this->errors)
TODO: get rid of properties in models classes (better use simple $variables)


BUGS & PROBLEMS

WEIRD: When tab is pinned in Firefox, the Facebook-Login will open another tab (WONTFIX ?)

lastInsertId() might be a not-optimal choice for multicore-high-traffic-environments,
maybe the last ID should be fetched in a cleaner way (asking for username)
