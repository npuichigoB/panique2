## To test facebook login LOCALLY:

When you register a new application on facebook (to qualify for facebook login) you'll have to provide the URL
of your project. This gets tricky when developing locally, but this is how it works:

For "App Domain", use "localhost".
For Sandbox mode, use "deactivated".
For Page URL, use "http://localhost/".
