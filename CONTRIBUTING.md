# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the php-login repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#pull-requests) from each feature branch to the **develop** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.
