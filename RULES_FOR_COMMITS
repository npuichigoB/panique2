Gentlemen, some simple rules for all commits (especially while working on the 3.0 version):

1. Always test your stuff. Seriously! Most of the commits are broken.
2. Always use a serious development tool that checks the syntax etc.! There's absolutely no reason to use a text editor
   that does NOT check your code.
3. Please stick to the PSR coding guidelines (super-simple stuff).
4. Please don't commit things that are not necessary, make things more complicated or break existing stuff. A good rule
   is: Simple, clean and small commits with useful features, not big ones that touch a lot of stuff. Let's move slow,
   this project is a security thing and we have some kind of responsibility here, we cannot allow to introduce real
   bugs.
5. Please don't commit multiple changes that are not related to each other with one pull request (as they are hard to
   split). If one feature is cool and the other is buggy, then both would be rejected.
   Golden rule: One commit per feature, One pull request per feature.

A big big thanks to everybody!
Good to see that lots of people like the project and keep on improving it.
