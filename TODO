REFACTORING / IMPROVEMENTS

TODO: Make it impossible to see the login form when logged in (even when directly url-typed)
TODO: refactor the deep if/else structures
TODO: rename rememberme to remember_me

BUGS & PROBLEMS

CLARIFY: Does the upper/lowercase in $login_model = $this->loadModel('Login'); matter ?
WEIRD: When tab is pinned in Firefox, the Facebook-Login will open another tab (WONTFIX ?)
BEAUTY: After logging in with Facebook the URL gets an ugly additional hash tag etc. like "#_=_"

GENERAL

1. Promote the usage of "better" passwords (long random "sentences", not letter-number-specialchar)
